# Readme-Generator

**1. Project Name:** Readme-Generator

**2. Tech Stack:**

This project utilizes a full-stack architecture combining the robust capabilities of Java on the backend with the dynamic user interface provided by React.js on the frontend.  The backend leverages the power of Maven for dependency management and project build.  The project also integrates with GitHub for authentication.  Further enhancing its functionality, the project incorporates Gemini-1.5-Flash, although its specific role within the application architecture requires further clarification.

* **Backend:** Java, SpringBoot, Maven
* **Frontend:** React.js
* **Authentication:** GitHub OAuth
* **Other:** Gemini-1.5-Flash (Further details needed for a comprehensive description)


**3. Modules and Packages:**

While a detailed breakdown of modules and packages requires deeper analysis of the source code, we can infer the general structure based on a typical full-stack application. We expect the project to contain at least the following functional modules:

* **Backend Modules:**
    * **Authentication Module:** Handles user authentication and authorization via GitHub OAuth.  This likely includes classes responsible for handling API requests, token management, and user data retrieval from GitHub.
    * **Readme Generation Module:** This is the core module responsible for processing user input, formatting the README content according to the specified structure, and generating the final README.md file. This module may utilize several sub-packages handling data validation, template processing, and Markdown formatting.
    * **Data Persistence Module (Potential):** If the application allows for saving or storing generated READMEs, this module would handle data persistence (e.g., using a database or file storage).
    * **API Module:**  Manages communication between the frontend and backend through RESTful APIs (if applicable).
* **Frontend Modules:**
    * **UI Module:**  This module handles the user interface, including input fields, form submission, result display, and error handling. It utilizes React.js components to build the interactive user experience.
    * **API Interaction Module:** Responsible for communicating with the backend APIs to submit requests and receive responses from the backend's Readme Generation module.


**4. Environment Variables:**

To ensure smooth operation, the Readme-Generator requires several environment variables.  Precise details depend on the GitHub OAuth integration and any external services used (e.g., databases).  This section provides a general outline; specific values and configurations need to be obtained based on your GitHub Application registration and other services.

* **`GITHUB_CLIENT_ID`:**  Your GitHub application client ID. Obtain this from your GitHub application settings.
* **`GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`:** Your GitHub application client secret. Obtain this from your GitHub application settings.
* **`GITHUB_CALLBACK_URL`:** The URL where GitHub will redirect users after authentication.  This needs to be configured in your GitHub application settings.
* **`(Other variables)`:** Depending on the implementation, additional environment variables might be required for database connections, API keys, or other services used within the application.

**Generating/Configuring Environment Variables:**

The method for setting environment variables differs depending on your operating system.  Common approaches include:

* **Linux/macOS:** Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project and set variables in KEY=VALUE format (e.g., `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id`).  Then, use a command like `source .env` to load them into your shell.
* **Windows:** Use the `set` command in the command prompt or set them via the system's environment variables settings.



**5. Setup Instructions:**

1. **Clone the Repository:** Clone this repository to your local machine using Git:

   ```bash
   git clone <https://github.com/Aarish2707/Readme-Generator>
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**  Change your current directory to the cloned project's root folder:

   ```bash
   cd Readme-Generator
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies (Backend):** Navigate to the backend project directory (likely found within the `src` directory) and run Maven to install necessary dependencies:

   ```bash
   mvn install
   ```

4. **Install Dependencies (Frontend):** Navigate to the frontend project directory (if it's a separate project) and install necessary npm packages:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

5. **Configure Environment Variables:** Set the required environment variables as outlined in section 4.

6. **Run the Application:** Execute the necessary commands to start both the backend and frontend servers.  This will vary depending on how the application is structured (e.g., using a build tool like Spring Boot for the backend).  Consult the project's documentation or source code for specific instructions.
