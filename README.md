## üöÄ **Tech Stack**

This project utilizes a combination of technologies to achieve its functionality.  The core backend is built using **Java 17** with the **Spring Boot 3.5.4** framework, managed by **Maven**.  The project also leverages **MongoDB** for data persistence, **Spring Security** for authentication and authorization, and **Spring WebFlux** for reactive web programming.  For authentication, it uses **OAuth2-Client** to integrate with external providers.  Deployment is facilitated by **Docker**.  The frontend technology is not specified in the provided repository analysis but is mentioned as React in the project description.  Finally,  **HTML** is used for some aspects of the application.


* **Java 17:** The primary programming language for the backend logic, providing a robust and mature platform for building the application's core functionality.  Its object-oriented nature facilitates modularity and maintainability.

* **Spring Boot 3.5.4:** A powerful framework built on top of the Spring Framework, simplifying the development of stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based applications. It provides features like auto-configuration, embedded servers, and simplified dependency management.

* **Maven:**  A project management and comprehension tool used to manage dependencies, build, and deploy the Java application. It simplifies the process of incorporating external libraries and ensures consistent build processes.

* **MongoDB:** A NoSQL document database used for storing and retrieving application data. Its flexible schema and scalability make it suitable for handling various data structures and large datasets.

* **Spring Security:** A comprehensive security framework that provides authentication, authorization, and protection against various web vulnerabilities. It integrates seamlessly with Spring Boot, simplifying the implementation of robust security measures.

* **Spring WebFlux:** A reactive web framework built on Project Reactor, enabling the creation of non-blocking, asynchronous applications. This improves scalability and responsiveness, especially under high load.

* **OAuth2-Client:**  A Spring Boot starter that simplifies the integration of OAuth 2.0 for secure authentication and authorization with external providers.  This allows users to log in using their existing accounts from services like GitHub.

* **Docker:** A containerization technology used to package the application and its dependencies into a portable, isolated environment. This simplifies deployment and ensures consistency across different environments.

* **HTML:** Used for creating and structuring parts of the user interface, working in conjunction with React.

## üì¶ **Modules and Packages**

Based on the provided `pom.xml`, the project's structure suggests a modular design, although specific module names aren't explicitly listed. The dependencies included point to a clear division of concerns:

### Core Modules:

* **Authentication Module (implied):**  This module likely handles user authentication and authorization, leveraging Spring Security and OAuth2-Client.  It manages user sessions, verifies credentials, and enforces access control policies.  Dependencies include `spring-boot-starter-security` and `spring-boot-starter-oauth2-client`.

* **Data Access Module (implied):**  This module interacts with the MongoDB database, using `spring-boot-starter-data-mongodb` to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. It encapsulates database interactions, providing an abstraction layer for the rest of the application.

* **API Module (implied):** This module exposes RESTful APIs using `spring-boot-starter-web` and `spring-boot-starter-webflux` for handling requests and responses. It's responsible for processing requests, interacting with other modules (such as the data access module), and returning appropriate responses.  The reactive capabilities of WebFlux suggest an emphasis on asynchronous processing for better performance.

* **Readme Generation Module (implied):** This module is the core business logic of the application. It's responsible for taking input (likely repository information), processing it, and generating the README.md file.  The dependency on `com.google.genai:google-genai` strongly suggests the use of Google's GenAI for natural language processing and content generation within this module.


### Inter-Module Interaction:

The modules interact through well-defined interfaces and dependencies. For example, the API module will call methods in the Readme Generation Module to create the README content. The Readme Generation Module may in turn call methods in the Data Access Module to retrieve or store repository information.  The Authentication Module secures access to these modules based on predefined roles and permissions.

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Environment Variables**

The `.env.example` file reveals several crucial environment variables required for the application to function correctly:

* **`MONGODB_URI`:** The connection string for the MongoDB database.  This variable should be populated with the actual connection string obtained from your MongoDB Atlas cluster or local instance.  **Obtain/Generate:**  Create a MongoDB Atlas cluster and retrieve the connection string from the cluster settings. For a local instance, use the appropriate URI format.

* **`GITHUB_CLIENT_ID`:** Your GitHub OAuth client ID.  **Obtain/Generate:** Register a new OAuth application in your GitHub settings to obtain these credentials.

* **`GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`:** Your GitHub OAuth client secret.  **Obtain/Generate:**  This is obtained during the GitHub OAuth application registration.  **Keep this secret secure; do not commit it to version control.**

* **`JWT_SECRET`:** A secret key used for generating JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) for authentication.  **Obtain/Generate:** Generate a strong, randomly generated secret key.  **Keep this secret secure; do not commit it to version control.**

* **`JWT_EXPIRATION`:** The expiration time for JWTs in milliseconds (default is 24 hours).  This can be adjusted as needed.

* **`GEMINI_API_KEY`:**  This variable suggests integration with a Gemini API.  The purpose is unclear without further context, but it likely involves access to external services for enhanced functionality.  **Obtain/Generate:** Obtain an API key from Gemini's documentation or developer portal.

* **`REDIRECT_URI`:** The redirect URI for the GitHub OAuth callback.  This should match the URL configured in your GitHub OAuth application.

* **`CALLBACK_URI`:**  The internal callback URI used by the application to handle the OAuth callback.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Setup Instructions**

### Prerequisites:

* Java Development Kit (JDK) 17 installed and configured.
* Maven installed and configured.
* MongoDB instance running (either locally or using a cloud service like MongoDB Atlas).
* Docker installed and configured.


### Installation Steps:

1. **Clone the repository:** `git clone <repository_url>`
2. **Navigate to the project directory:** `cd Readme-Generator`
3. **Create a `.env` file:** Copy the contents of `.env.example` to a new file named `.env`, and populate it with your environment variables.  **Ensure that sensitive information like `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET` and `JWT_SECRET` is kept secure and not committed to the repository.**
4. **Build the application:** `./mvnw clean package`
5. **Build the Docker image:** `docker build -t readme-generator .`
6. **Run the Docker container:** `docker run -p 8080:8080 readme-generator`


### Configuration:

The application is primarily configured through environment variables.  Ensure that the `.env` file is correctly populated with the necessary credentials.


### Running the Application:

After successfully building and running the Docker container, the application should be accessible at `http://localhost:8080`.

### Troubleshooting:

* **Connection errors:** Verify that your MongoDB connection string is correct and that the MongoDB instance is running.
* **Authentication errors:** Check that your GitHub OAuth client ID and secret are correctly configured.
* **Build errors:** Ensure that all dependencies are correctly resolved by Maven. Examine the Maven build output for specific error messages.

## üöÄ **Usage Examples**

Specific usage examples depend on the details of the React frontend.  However, the backend likely accepts input describing a repository (e.g., GitHub repository URL) and returns a generated README.md file as output.  The React frontend would provide the user interface for interacting with the backend API.  The generated README.md would follow a predefined structure based on the input repository data and potentially use Google GenAI to dynamically generate parts of the README content.  The exact API calls and data formats would need to be determined by examining the source code.
